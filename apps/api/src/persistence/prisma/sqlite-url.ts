 * One rule for every consumer: a relative path resolves against the **working directory**. Left
 * alone, the Prisma CLI resolves it against the folder of prisma.config.ts while the app resolves it
 * against its cwd — two different files, and an app that silently runs on an empty database. Both
 * prisma.config.ts and PrismaService call this, and every script runs from the repo root (the
 * container from /app), so they always agree.
