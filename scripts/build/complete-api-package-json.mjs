/**
 * Completes the runtime `package.json` that `nx build api` writes to dist/apps/api.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `generatePackageJson` derives dependencies from what webpack bundled. Two categories escape it,
 * and both fail at *runtime* rather than at build time — which is the worst place to find out:
 *
 *   - **webpack externals.** `oidc-provider` and `openid-client` are ESM-only and deliberately
 *     marked external in webpack.config.js, loaded through dynamic `import()`. Nothing bundles
 *     them, so nothing declares them. A container built without them starts fine and dies on the
 *     first login attempt.
 *   - **transitive requires of generated code.** The Prisma client under src/generated pulls in
 *     `@prisma/client`, and tsc's helpers pull in `tslib`. Missing `@prisma/client` kills the
 *     process at boot.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-08, the generated manifest was missing exactly those four.
 *
 * WHY IT DETECTS RATHER THAN HARDCODES
 *
 * A hardcoded list is right once and then rots silently — the next external added to
 * webpack.config.js would reintroduce the same class of runtime crash, and nothing would say so.
 * This scans the built bundle for module specifiers it actually requires or imports, and adds any
 * that the manifest does not declare, pinned to the exact version this workspace resolved. A short
 * explicit list covers what the container needs but never imports — see RUNTIME_TOOLS below.
 *
 * Run as the second step of `nx build api`. Also runnable by hand:
 *   node scripts/build/complete-api-package-json.mjs
